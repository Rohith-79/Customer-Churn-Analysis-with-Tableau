# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores customer churn for a subscription-based business using data visualizations created in Tableau. By identifying factors that contribute to churn, the project aims to help the business make data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Objective
The goal is to analyze customer churn data to uncover insights such as:
- Primary reasons for customer churn
- Demographic patterns among churned customers
- Impact of contract type, payment method, and service calls on churn
- Influence of data consumption and international plans on churn rates

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Data was loaded and cleaned directly in Tableau, focusing on relevant metrics for visualization.
2. **Data Visualization**: A variety of dashboards and interactive visualizations were created to represent key insights.
3. **Insights & Analysis**: The visualizations highlight correlations between churn and factors such as age, contract length, service usage, and international plans.

## Visualizations
1. **Overview Dashboard**: 
   - Displays churn metrics, reasons for churn, and churn rates by state.
   - Visualizes customer counts and churn categories for an at-a-glance understanding.

2. **Age Brackets & Groups**:
   - Analyzes churn rates across different age groups and account tenure.
   - Provides insight into which demographic segments have higher churn rates.

3. **Payments & Contracts**:
   - Explores the impact of contract type and payment method on churn.
   - Shows churn rate variations based on service call frequency and contract length.

4. **International Plans & Data Consumption**:
   - Examines the relationship between international plan usage, data consumption, and churn.
   - Highlights how data usage levels influence churn rates across customer segments.

## Tools
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Key Insights
- Competitor offers and device quality are major drivers of churn.
- Month-to-month contracts and direct debit payment methods correlate with higher churn rates.
- Customers with international plans have significantly higher churn rates, especially with high data charges.

## Usage
1. Open the Tableau workbook file (`Customer Churn Analysis.twbx`) in Tableau to explore the dashboards.
2. Use interactive filters to drill down into specific customer segments and churn reasons.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a visual and data-driven understanding of factors influencing churn in a subscription business. The insights can guide targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
